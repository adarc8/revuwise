    <h1>RevuWise Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 19, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how RevuWise ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our Chrome Extension (the "Extension").</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you use the Extension on a supported hotel page (e.g., Booking.com):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hotel Information:</strong> We extract the hotel name and country code from the page URL to identify the hotel being viewed.</li>
        <li><strong>Review Data:</strong> We scrape publicly available reviews from the current hotel page.</li>
        <li><strong>User Questions:</strong> We collect the questions you type into the chat interface.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is sent to our backend server for processing.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Process hotel reviews to create summaries and enable semantic search.</li>
        <li>Generate answers to your questions based on the review data using AI models (e.g., OpenAI).</li>
        <li>Temporarily cache processed review data to improve performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Session data (including processed reviews and embeddings) is stored temporarily on our backend server during your active session. Cache data may be stored for a limited time (e.g., 24 hours) to speed up processing for frequently viewed hotels. We implement reasonable measures to protect the data, but no system is completely secure.</p>
    <p>Your API keys (if applicable, like OpenAI keys) are stored securely on our backend server and are not shared.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use third-party AI services (like OpenAI or Anthropic) to process reviews and generate answers. Your questions and relevant review snippets are sent to these services. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for how they handle data.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share your personal information or the collected review data with third parties, except as necessary to provide the Extension's functionality (e.g., sending data to AI providers).</p>

    <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can uninstall the Extension at any time to stop data collection.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension or on our website.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
